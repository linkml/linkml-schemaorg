# LinkML Project Template

_A template for LinkML projects_

This repo requires poetry as a system dependency

https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

Once the poetry application is installed and the repo is cloned, run this once: `poetry install` to get the python dependencies

Rename [src/linkml/my-project.yaml](src/linkml/my-project.yaml) to your own project name

Then type:

```bash
make all
```

you will get a project directory with derived artifacts, including the python classes

more on documentation later
